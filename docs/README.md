# SLICK -- Suite of Line Intensity Calculations (by Karol ;)
#### SLICK is a tool that calculates many different line intensities from large sets of clouds/galaxies.
#### It was designed to work for SIMBA simulation datasets, but it will be expanded and generalized in the near future.

## How it works
#### 1) It takes a SIMBA snapshot and its caesar catalog, and write the relevant information from all its particles in a pandas dataframe (which will be saved as "Basic_Characteristics*")
#### 2) It creates a file with lists of cloud IDs (which will be saved as "Clouds_per_Core*"). Each line represents the IDs that will be passed to each core.
#### 3) It runs despotic on all the particles (or on a random set of those depending on the given parameters), and outputs a table with their CO, C+ and CII luminosities.

## How to use
`setup.sh` marks the two frontend scripts as executable and adds the bin directory to the path.
This only needs to happen once ever.
```bash
bash setup.sh
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

To create a template slick project, run `slick_new.sh`. This creates [parameters.ini](#parameters-file) and `run.sh`.
`run.sh` calls slick_frontend.sh. It assumes slick_frontend.sh is on the path, so this will need to be changed if you haven't run `setup.sh` previously.
Running `sbatch run.sh` will enqueue the job for the slick_init step and the slick_run step (unless the skip_run option is set).

### Parameters File
The behavior of slick is configured by the parameters.ini file. The following describes the options currently available.
```ini
[snap]
; This is used when naming the clouds_per_core file.
boxsize=[int]
; The full path to the yt file being operated on.
ytfilename=[str]
; The full path to the caesar file being operated on.
caesarfilename=[str]

[sample]
; Either 'total' or 'randomized'.
; Determines whether slick should operate on all clouds or a sample of clouds.
mode=[str]
; How many galaxies should slick operate on.
; Only required if mode = 'randomized'
n_galaxies_sample=[int]
; Minimum galaxy mass bound to operate on.
; Only required if mode = 'randomized'
min_mass=[float]
; Maximum galaxy mass bound to operate on.
; Only required if mode = 'randomized'
max_mass=[float]

[sbatch]
; This section takes any key value pairs which can be used in a job script as 
#SBATCH --key=value
; These are used to configure the slurm job for the slick_run step.
; The only parameter not configurable is array, which is set by slick to match the number of runs being prepared.
; The following is the default configuration
nodes=1
tasks-per-node=1
cpus-per-task=1
mem-per-cpu=8gb
time=96:00:00
output=/dev/null

[run]
; The directory which slick should output its files.
; This does not include any logs generated by slurm.
; To change the output of those, use the output parameter in [sbatch]
; Defaults to Output_Files
output_dir=[str]
; If true, only the slick_init step is run.
; The slick_run step can be triggered manually via `sbatch slick_run_jobscript.sh`
; Defaults to false
skip_run=[bool]
