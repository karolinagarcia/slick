# how to use

Make sure you have the appropriate modules loaded and are in your slick conda environment:
```
  module load gcc/12.2.0 gsl/2.7
  conda activate slick
```

To initialize a slick run, use ``slick new``.
All the init step does is copy a ``parameters.ini`` and ``job.sh`` file into your current directory.
Presets are found in the ``slick/src/slick/presets/`` directory.
Currently only the default "narayanan" preset is shipped, but more can be made simply by adding "{name}.ini" and "{name}.sh" to the preset directory.
Any users not on HiPerGator are welcome to submit a PR adding their own presets.
``sbatch job.sh`` will queue the slick initialization step.
If the skip_run option is not set in the parameter file, the initialization step will automatically queue the run step of slick.

#### **options in the parameters file**

The behavior of slick is configured by the parameters.ini file. The following describes the options currently available.
```ini
[snap]
; This is used when naming the clouds_per_core file.
boxsize=[int]
; The full path to the yt file being operated on.
ytfilename=[str]
; The full path to the caesar file being operated on.
caesarfilename=[str]

[sample]
; Either 'total' or 'randomized'.
; Determines whether slick should operate on all clouds or a sample of clouds.
mode=[str]
; How many galaxies should slick operate on.
; Only require√üd if mode = 'randomized'
n_galaxies_sample=[int]
; Minimum galaxy mass bound to operate on.
; Only required if mode = 'randomized'
min_mass=[float]
; Maximum galaxy mass bound to operate on.
; Only required if mode = 'randomized'
max_mass=[float]

[sbatch]
; This section takes any key value pairs which can be used in a job script as 
#SBATCH --key=value
; These are used to configure the slurm job for the slick_run step.
; The only parameter not configurable is array, which is set by slick to match the number of runs being prepared.
; The following is the default configuration
nodes=1
tasks-per-node=1
cpus-per-task=1
mem-per-cpu=8gb
time=96:00:00
output=/dev/null

[run]
; The directory which slick should output its files.
; This does not include any logs generated by slurm.
; To change the output of those, use the output parameter in [sbatch]
; Defaults to Output_Files
output_dir=[str]
; If true, only the slick_init step is run.
; The slick_run step can be triggered manually via `sbatch slick_run_jobscript.sh`
; Defaults to false
skip_run=[bool]
```
